# Force3D
A game engine mostly created by pulling together college work in OpenTK, and a previous attempt to make a 2D console based game engine. At the moment, most functionality has to be coded by the developer, however rendering is fully handled by the engine itself.

From a developer's point of view, the engine is reminiscent of Unity, as that is the engine that I am most familiar with. I hope that the Unity3D team dont try and sue me over this, but all the code is mine, it is just some ideas that I have copied.

The code is reasonably well documented, and I have included an example program that uses Force
